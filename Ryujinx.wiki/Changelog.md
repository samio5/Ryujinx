# Ryujinx Changelog
All updates to the Ryujinx official master build will be documented in this file.

For 1.0.x releases, see [here](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/wiki/Older-Changelog).

## 1.1.1216-1.1.1217 - 2024-03-02
### Changed:
- infra: Make Avalonia the default UI.
- Replaces the old GTK user interface with the Avalonia-based UI as the default on Windows and Linux (macOS already had it). Avalonia has feature parity with GTK, plus the following differences:
  - Volume level can now be adjusted from the bottom status bar.
  - Default controller profile will now be automatically loaded upon selecting a new controller. 
  - Improved the controller applet considerably, with a menu button to go directly into input settings.
  - Added a customizable grid view for the games list.  
  - Added a game loading screen which displays PPTC and shader cache progress.
  - Added configurable hotkeys for vsync toggle (framerate limiter), screenshots, mute/unmute audio, increase/decrease volume and increase/decrease resolution.
  - Added a save manager under Options > Manage User Profiles. Allows for easy file deletion and quick save folder opening. Also adds an option to restore deleted user profiles using existing saves. (Backup/restore functionality is still being worked on.)
  - Added Brazilian Portuguese, Castilian Spanish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Turkish and Ukrainian localizations for UI text.
  - Fixes issues with emulator files not being properly extracted sometimes.
  - Fixes an issue where PCs with 2 graphics cards (especially laptops) wouldn't properly detect the GPU, crashing on boot.
  - Fixes the occasional "GTK Critical" crash when double-clicking to run games.
  - Fixes a crash where some games, such as the Monster Hunter series, would error out when bringing up the software keyboard due to missing fonts in the system.

### Fixed:
- Fix a crash occurring when trying to launch a game with Vulkan on FlatHub releases.

## 1.1.200 - 2022-07-31
### Added:
- Vulkan backend.
- Implemented a Vulkan graphics backend. You can now switch between OpenGL and Vulkan in Settings > Graphics > Graphics Backend.
  - Implemented a GPU selector in the same menu, labeled "Preferred GPU", for systems with more than one graphics card. Keep in mind you can only select the GPU that Vulkan will use, not the one OpenGL will use. 
  - Added a "Texture Recompression" option in graphics settings which, when enabled, will reduce VRAM usage in exchange for slightly worse texture quality (affects both Vulkan and OpenGL). We recommend this for graphics cards that have less than 4GB VRAM.
  - When using Vulkan, AMD and Intel GPUs will see large improvements in compatibility and performance across the board. Use latest graphics drivers for the best experience.
  - Implemented SPIR-V shader backend. Reduces shader compilation times considerably for all GPU vendors, compared to OpenGL's GLSL backend. This results in much less stuttering on first runs.
  - Vulkan supports supersampling at higher than 2x the display resolution, which acts as antialiasing when the rendering resolution is higher than the display's, whereas OpenGL only supports it up to 2x the screen resolution.
  - Vulkan may not have graphical glitches that OpenGL has, such as the co-op player 2 screen in Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes.
  - Certain games, such as Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Pokkén Tournament, Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, have shown slightly better performance on Nvidia Vulkan than on Nvidia OpenGL. 
  - Shader caches from before this change will be deleted, and new shader caches will be starting from zero. This is due to Vulkan and OpenGL caches now being shared.
  - Shader caches built with Vulkan will now be usable with OpenGL and vice versa.
  - Vulkan shaders do not require to be rebuilt after driver updates; however, OpenGL shaders still do.
