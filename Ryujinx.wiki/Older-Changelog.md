## 1.0.7079 - 2021-10-18
### Added:
- Add an early 'TailMerge' pass.
  - No changes expected on games.

## 1.0.7078 - 2021-10-18
### Fixed:
- Add initial tessellation shader support.
  - Fixes sand not rendering in Luigi's Mansion 3.

## 1.0.7077 - 2021-10-17
### Fixed:
- Add missing U8/S8 types from shader I2I instruction.
  - Fixes a regression introduced in 1.0.7069 where in some cases an exception would be thrown when emitting code for a shader.

## 1.0.7076 - 2021-10-17
### Fixed:
- Extend bindless elimination to work with masked and shifted handles.
  - Combined with the change in 1.0.7073, makes Hades render almost correctly.
  - Improves rendering in The Witcher 3.

## 1.0.7075 - 2021-10-17
### Added:
- Implement SHF (funnel shift) shader instruction.
  - Improves rendering on Cotton/Guardian Saturn Tribute games, and potentially other games.

## 1.0.7074 - 2021-10-13
### Fixed:
- Fixes a regression introduced on version 1.0.7067 that caused some games using the foreground software keyboard applet and the Mii editor to crash.

## 1.0.7073 - 2021-10-12
### Fixed:
- Fixes an issue of Vulkan (from the guest) draw methods by forcing the state to be dirty when the indexed draw registers are written to.
  - Only affects games using the Vulkan API as other APIs do not use those registers.

## 1.0.7072 - 2021-10-12
### Fixed:
- Enqueue frame before signalling the frame is ready.
  - Fixes performance lowering after some loading transitions in Link's Awakening and Xenoblade DE.

## 1.0.7071 - 2021-10-12
### Changed:
- Don't force scaling on 2D copy sources since it only needs to scale if the texture already exists and was scaled by rendering or something else. 
  - This will also avoid the destination being scaled if the source wasn't. The copy can handle mismatching scales just fine.
  - This prevents scaling artifacts in GMS games, and maybe others (not Super Mario Maker 2, that has another issue).

## 1.0.7070 - 2021-10-12
### Added:
- Added Vp8 codec support.
  - Fixes videos in Diablo II, TY The Tasmanian Tiger and probably more games.

## 1.0.7069 - 2021-10-12
### Changed:
- Rewrite shader decoding stage.
  - Changes the way how shader instructions are decoded by using a separate struct per instruction variant. This may be a bit wasteful, but we beleive it's the best way to avoid some errors, and also to avoid special handling on the instruction implementation.
  - Now all the shader instructions are on the table (not all of them are actually implemented, of course), this should facilitate future work when we need to actually implement those instructions.
  - Fixes inexistent fields in one of the double instructions.
  - Fixes SAT using the FTZ bit in one of the half instruction.
  - Fixes wrong bit in TLD.B AOFFI.
    - Fixes some rendering in Jump Force and probably other games.

## 1.0.7068 - 2021-10-12
### Added:
- Implemented GetConfig of spl service.
  - Fixes startup crash in some homebrews.

## 1.0.7067 - 2021-10-12
### Changed:
- Implemented the inline software keyboard without input pop up dialog in the GUI since a way to display the text is already provided by the games.
  - Supports non-ASCII text, selection, copy and paste, overwrite mode, toggling input (on and off so keyboard players can input text correctly),  the new Calc format used by newer games.
  - Fixes some software keyboard issues in Monster Hunter games and more.

## 1.0.7066 - 2021-10-08
### Changed:
- Optimize the JIT linear scan register allocator.
  - The speed of PPTC compilation is greatly improved, in some cases taking half of the time compared to the previous version.
  - First run or runs with PPTC disabled have also been improved, now taking less time to reach the peak performance.

## 1.0.7065 - 2021-10-07
### Fixed:
- Implement the VIC X8B8G8R8 output pixel format.
  - Fixes missing videos (black screen) on Metroid Dread title screen, menus, new ability guides, area change loading screens and more.

## 1.0.7064 - 2021-10-07
### Fixed:
- Reregister flush actions when taking a buffer's modified range list.
  - Fixes a regression introduced in 1.0.7061, where buffer flush would not happen for data written before buffers were joined.

## 1.0.7063 - 2021-10-05
### Changed:
- Enable branch tightening when PPTC is enabled.
  - Slightly better JIT code generation with PPTC enabled.
  - PPTC cache size was reduced by a few KB as a result.

## 1.0.7062 - 2021-10-05
### Fixed:
- Fixes wrong name size on DisplayInfo structure.
  - Fixes a regression introduced on version 1.0.7041 that caused Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, and maybe other games to crash on boot.

## 1.0.7061 - 2021-10-04
### Changed:
- Reduces cost for range list creation and inheritance.
  - Fixes potential performance regression introduced on version 1.0.7044.

## 1.0.7060 - 2021-10-04
### Fixed:
- Allow textures to be used without having a sampler pool set.
  - Improves rendering on Cotton Guardian Force Saturn Tribute.

## 1.0.7059 - 2021-10-04
### Fixed:
- Fixes a bug introduced on version 1.0.7052 that could cause a memory leak and eventually a crash playing H264 videos.

## 1.0.7058 - 2021-09-28
### Added:
- Added the ability to signal a write as "precise" on the tracking, which signals a special handler (if present) which can be used to avoid unnecessary flush actions, or maybe even more. For buffers, precise writes specifically do not flush, and instead punch a hole in the modified range list to indicate that the data on GPU has been replaced.
  - Fixed regressions from a previous change (in Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, Rune Factory 4 and more).

## 1.0.7057 - 2021-09-28
### Fixed:
- Force copy when auto-deleting a texture with dependencies.
  - Fixes broken lighting caused by pausing in SMO's Metro Kingdom. May fix some other infrequent issues.

## 1.0.7056 - 2021-09-28
### Fixed:
- Only make render target 2D textures layered if needed.
  - Fixed The Legend of Heroes: Zero no Kiseki which is now playable.

## 1.0.7055 - 2021-09-28
### Added:
- Added a set of optimizations to the HybridAllocator which increases the throughput of LCQ and usually shaves a couple of seconds from boot time.

## 1.0.7054 - 2021-09-28
### Fixed:
- Use normal memory store path for DC ZVA as an optimized way to clear memory in homebrew applications.

## 1.0.7053 - 2021-09-28
### Added:
- Implemented/Stubbed some clkrst service calls which are needed by some homebrew.

## 1.0.7052 - 2021-09-28
### Fixed:
- Use separate contexts per channel and decode frames in DTS order.
  - Decoding multiple videos at once no longer causes image corruption.
  - As a result of the hack removal, H264 video playback should be smoother now, without duplicate frames (please note that the game may still decide to duplicate frames or not present anything if the decoding is too slow, YMMV).
  - Some minor issues like a few games flashing a green frame when the video starts have also been fixed.
  - Add missing field_pic_order_in_frame_present_flag flag to the stream PPS. Fixes decoding errors on Layton's Mystery Journey, but the video is still not rendered properly due to VIC Issues.
  - Add new Trim method on NVDEC's SurfaceCache to allow cached frames to be freed. It is called every time a context is destroyed. Cache access now uses a lock to make it thread safe, as Trim may be called from outside the NVDEC thread.
    - Fixed some videos in Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix and No More Heroes 3.

## 1.0.7051 - 2021-09-28
### Fixed:
- Fixed PTC count table relocation patching introduced in a previous change where by 2 different count table entry addresses were used for LCQ functions.

## 1.0.7050 - 2021-09-28
### Added:
- Stubbed some irs service calls which are needed to get some games playable or bootable.
  - Night Vision and Spy Alarm are now bootable (but still unplayable due to the lack of the IR data).

## 1.0.7049 - 2021-09-28
### Fixed:
- Fixed an issue where scales might not be properly updated on games that uses compute.
  - Fixed resolution scale issues on Ni no Kuni 2.

## 1.0.7048 - 2021-09-28
### Fixed:
- Updated the game compatibility infos in README file.

## 1.0.7047 - 2021-09-19
### Added:
- Adds a method to PhysicalMemory that attempts to write all cached resources directly, so that memory tracking can be avoided. The goal of this is both to avoid flushing buffer data, and to avoid raising the sequence number when data is written, which causes buffer and texture handles to be re-checked.
  - Improves performance on Xenoblade 2 and DE, which were flushing buffer data on the GPU thread when trying to write compute data.
  - May improve performance in other games that write SSBOs from compute, and update data in the same/nearby pages often.

## 1.0.7046 - 2021-09-19
### Added:
- Implements an augmented interval tree based off of the existing TreeDictionary and uses it for the MultiRangeList. This greatly speeds up texture overlap checks, as they can't use the non-overlapping fast path that buffers and tracking handles can use. Like the tree dictionary, it is based on a red-black tree and is self balancing.
  - Speed up texture/view creation and notifying textures that they have been unmapped, which might reduce stuttering in unreal engine games.

## 1.0.7045 - 2021-09-19
### Added:
- Uses new subgroup extension (that AFAIK were introduced for SPIR-V) if the old ARB_shader_ballot extension is not supported. This is required for Vulkan. Additionally, this benefits Intel on OpenGL as they don't support the ARB_shader_ballot extension on the proprietary driver for some reason, but does support the new extensions.
  - Astral Chain and probably some other games works on Intel OpenGL now.

## 1.0.7044 - 2021-09-19
### Added:
- Changes the RangeList to cache the Address and EndAddress within the list itself rather than accessing them from the object's properties.
  - Greatly improves performance in Super Mario Odyssey (~1.25x), Xenoblade (required some WIP code for now) and most other GPU limited games.
  - Improvement will generally depend on how many buffers the game binds and how many draws it does.

## 1.0.7043 - 2021-09-19
### Fixed:
- Set texture/image bindings in place rather than allocating and passing an array.

## 1.0.7042 - 2021-09-19
### Fixed:
- Amadeus: Fixes regression from 1.7040 on ListAudioDeviceName.

## 1.0.7041 - 2021-09-19
### Fixed:
- Unified values and accurated implementation of resolutions in vi service.
  - am calls GetDefaultDisplayResolution / GetDefaultDisplayResolutionChangeEvent have more informations on what the service does.
  - vi:u/vi:m/vi:s GetDisplayService are now accurate.
    - IApplicationDisplay GetRelayService, GetSystemDisplayService, GetManagerDisplayService, GetIndirectDisplayTransactionService, ListDisplays, OpenDisplay, OpenDefaultDisplay, CloseDisplay, GetDisplayResolution are now properly implemented.
  - Some other calls are cleaned or have extra checks accordingly to RE.
- Additionnaly, IFriendService have some wrong aligned things, and `pm:info` service placeholder was missing. 

## 1.0.7040 - 2021-09-19
### Added:
- Amadeus: Implements all the changes made with REV10 (audio service) on 13.0.0.

## 1.0.7039 - 2021-09-18
### Fixed:
- Pause/Resume entry in Action menu now is properly disabled after switching to fullscreen mode.
- An issue with the Pause changes was fixed that caused Ryujinx to not be properly close.

## 1.0.7038 - 2021-09-15
### Fixed:
- Fixes a regression introduced in 1.0.7034, when you try to extract data from games dump.

## 1.0.7037 - 2021-09-14
### Fixed:
- FPS monitor now shows instantaneous FPS rather than any form of weighted average.
- Frametime has been added as a metric with a 2 decimal place precision factor.
- All performance metrics now update every 750ms rather than 1000ms.

## 1.0.7036 - 2021-09-14
### Fixed:
- Add Linux Unicorn (for Tests) patch and description.

## 1.0.7035 - 2021-09-14
### Fixed:
- HOS project cleanup.

## 1.0.7034 - 2021-09-14
### Fixed:
- Replace FileChooserDialog with FileChooserNative.
  - Fixes a crash when you add a drive as folder.

## 1.0.7033 - 2021-09-13
### Fixed:
- Refactor PtcInfo.
  - Reduces the coupling of PtcInfo and the backend by moving relocation tracking to the backend. RelocEntrys remains as RelocEntrys through out the pipeline until it actually needs to be written to the PTC streams. Keeping this representation makes inspecting and manipulating relocations after compilations less painful.

## 1.0.7032 - 2021-09-11
### Fixed:
- Account for negative strides on DMA copy.
  - Math.Abs is used on the stride to calculate the size, to ensure it is positive.
  - If stride is negative, the base offset is adjusted to the real start offset of the copy.
- Changed the flush call on InlineToMemory to use the GPU memory manager rather than the physical one, to account for non-contiguous memory.
  - Idol Days no longer crashes when trying to open the log or load/save the game, although it does have other issues there that don't seem to be caused by this change.

## 1.0.7031 - 2021-09-11
### Added:
- Implements GetVaRegions in nv service.
  - Fixes a crash on Quake which can progress further, now it crashes due to Sockets issues.

## 1.0.7030 - 2021-09-11
### Fixed:
- Fixes ICommonStateGetter GetDefaultDisplayResolution returned resolution while using Docked Mode.
  - Fixes Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon- rendering and probably some other games.

## 1.0.7029 - 2021-09-11
### Added:
- Added "Pause Emulation" option which could be found at menu "Actions > Pause Emulation" or using F5 hotkey.

## 1.0.7028 - 2021-09-11
### Fixed:
- Lift textures in the AutoDeleteCache for all modifications.

### Fixed:
- Fixes single quote key incorrectly mapped in our GTK3 code.

## 1.0.7026 - 2021-09-11
### Fixed:
- Fixes time played staying at 0 second when "Stop Emulation" is pressed.

## 1.0.7025 - 2021-09-11
### Fixed:
- Remove error dialog when files encountered weren't of a valid type.

## 1.0.7024 - 2021-09-02
### Fixed:
- Fixes shaders using the TXQ instruction failing to compile if more than 2 dimensions are being read.
  - Fixes some (but not all) lighting issues on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, and other UE4 games.

## 1.0.7023 - 2021-08-31
### Added:
- Implements support for the shader image atomic instructions.
  - Fixes object interaction not animating on Yoshi Crafted World in some levels.
  - Fixes missing lighting on several UE4 games, such as Bravely Default 2, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, No More Heroes 3, Densha de Go!! and more.
  - Fixes missing facial animations on several UE4 games, such as Bravely Default 2 and Trials of Mana.

## 1.0.7022 - 2021-08-30
### Fixed:
- Fixes shader shuffle up instruction, when the source thread ID is out of range.
  - Fixes vertex explosions on Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3.

## 1.0.7021 - 2021-08-29
### Fixed:
- Improves handling of multi-draw with indirect count on HLE macros, for cases where the start draw is non-zero.
  - No visible changes expected, as no game is known to hit this case so far.

## 1.0.7020 - 2021-08-29
### Fixed:
- Fixes a bug that would cause textures that do not overlap, but is assumed to overlap because gaps on the memory region where the data is located is not taken into account, to be removed from the cache, causing data loss.
  - Fixes "white screen" issue on several Unreal Engine 4 games, including Yoshi Crafted World, Disaster Report 4, No More Heroes 3, JUMP FORCE Deluxe Edition and more.
  - Some instances of glowing objects were also fixed.
  - Note that this does not fix all texture issues with those games, but they are greatly improved now.

## 1.0.7019 - 2021-08-29
### Fixed:
- Fixes a case where threads would not wait until the GPU written data is flushed if more than one thread was trying to access it at the same time.
  - Fixes a regression introduced on version 1.0.7016 that caused Catherine Full Body to crash randomly with guest memory corruption.

## 1.0.7018 - 2021-08-27
### Changed:
- Avoid redundant texture scale updates.
  - Minor performance improvements on some games, most notably Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition.

## 1.0.7017 - 2021-08-26
### Added:
- Added support for attribute indexing, required by Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, and a few other games.
  - This improves the rendering on some Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze levels.

## 1.0.7016 - 2021-08-26
### Added:
- The Graphic Abstraction Layer is now multithreaded.
  - Allows more finer controls over vendor drivers.
    - Allows to disable NVIDIA threaded optimization and remove stuttering related to it.
  - Allows multithreaded shader compilation at runtime and reduce stuttering when multiple shaders can be build at the same time.
  - This can be enabled or disabled via an option in the settings called "Backend Threading". The default option is "Auto", which always means on right now, but could change for some vendors or backends.
  - Consult the [pull request](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/pull/2501) for more details.

## 1.0.7015 - 2021-08-26
### Added:
- Implement MSR instruction for A32.
  - Pocket Rumble is now playable.

## 1.0.7014 - 2021-08-26
### Added:
- Added support for HLE macros allowing to improve macro efficiency.
  - For now, the only HLE macro function implemented is MultiDrawElementsIndirectCount, used by Monster Hunter Rise.

## 1.0.7013 - 2021-08-26
### Fixed:
- Remove missing unicorn files included in the Tests project.
  - Fixes build warning.

## 1.0.7012 - 2021-08-26
### Fixed:
- Updates to the 0.13.3 bugfix release of LibHac and removes the workaround introduced in PR #2576.
  - Fixes regression: SD card saves will now be placed in /Nintendo/save instead of /save/Nintendo.

## 1.0.7011 - 2021-08-26
### Changed:
- Added fallbacks for all Audio backends.
  - SDL2 is now the default audio backend, then OpenAL, then SoundIO. 

## 1.0.7010 - 2021-08-26
### Fixed:
- Swap BGR565 components by changing the format.
  - Fixes regression on some homebrew using a BGR565 framebuffer that stopped rendering.

## 1.0.7009 - 2021-08-26
### Fixed:
- Update to Ryujinx.SDL2-CS 2.0.17 (Fix runtime issues on Gentoo)

## 1.0.7008 - 2021-08-20
### Fixed:
- Adds a workaround for a Libhac issue where an exception is thrown when trying to delete an inexistent folder recursively.

## 1.0.7007 - 2021-08-20
### Fixed:
- Fixes spelling on some UI dialogs.

## 1.0.7006 - 2021-08-20
### Fixed:
- Allows swapping R and B components on BGR565 and BGRA5551 texture formats.
  - Fixes swapped red/blue issue on Pokkén Tournament DX.

## 1.0.7004 - 2021-08-20
### Changed:
- Removes overlapping textures from the texture cache, if the overlapping texture is not view compatible with the existing one, and its data has been modified.
  - Greatly reduces memory usage in Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition and Xenoblade Chronicles 2, in areas with high usage (like Gormott).
  - Fixes crashes and performance issues caused by the system running out of memory.

## 1.0.7003 - 2021-08-20
### Fixed:
- Fixes errors from reading the SD card when encryption keys have changed.
  - This caused an error when launching Super Smash Bros. Ultimate with an old SD card save directory.

## 1.0.7002 - 2021-08-20
### Fixed:
- Fixes wrong base level calculation when copying data to slices of 3D textures.
  - Fixes 3D texture data not being properly updated in some rare cases.
  - The bug was observed on Super Mario Odyssey. Other games using 3D textures might be affected too.

## 1.0.7001 - 2021-08-20
### Fixed:
- Fixes an assert that was happening on debug builds since version 1.0.7000, due to an optimization creating a constant operand with the wrong type.
  - Should not have any visible effect on games as the bug did not cause wrong code generation.

## 1.0.7000 - 2021-08-17
### Changed:
- Optimizes JIT memory allocations by using an arena allocator, along with other optimizations.
  - Greatly improves PPTC compilation speeds, reducing the total duration by around 20%-60% depending on the game.
  - Lowers memory usage when rebuilding PPTC.
  - Reduces stutters and time taken to reach peak performance with PPTC disabled and on the first run (before PPTC is built).
  - Fixes a bug that could cause incorrect code to be generated in some rare cases, where a shift value was overwritten with an incorrect value.

## 1.0.6999 - 2021-08-17
### Fixed:
- Fixes a crash that could happen when mounting save data if the keys or SD seed changed.

## 1.0.6998 - 2021-08-17
### Fixed:
- Allows transform feedback data to be flushed when accessed from CPU.
  - Fixes some vertex explosions on SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy.

## 1.0.6997 - 2021-08-12
### Changed:
- Updates the LibHac dependency to version 0.13.1. This improves the accuracy of the emulator file system implementation, and solve some file system and save related issues on games. See below for a more detailed list of changes.
  - Refactor `FsSrv` to match the official refactoring done in FS.
  - Change how the `Horizon` and `HorizonClient` classes are handled. Each client created represents a different process with its own process ID and client state.
  - Add FS access control to handle permissions for FS service method calls.
  - Add FS program registry to keep track of the program ID, location and permissions of each process.
  - Add FS program index map info manager to track the program IDs and indexes of multi-application programs.
  - Add all FS IPC interfaces.
  - Rewrite `Fs.Fsa` code to be more accurate.
  - Rewrite a lot of `FsSrv` code to be more accurate.
  - Extend directory save data to store `SaveDataExtraData`
  - Extend directory save data to lock the save directory to allow only one accessor at a time.
  - Improve waiting and retrying when encountering access issues in `LocalFileSystem` and `DirectorySaveDataFileSystem`.
  - More `IFileSystemProxy` methods should work now.
  - Probably a bunch more stuff.

## 1.0.6996 - 2021-08-12
### Changed
- Improves error message when the prod.keys file is present, but the keys are outdated.
  - Now the "Ryujinx was unable to parse the provided firmware. This is usually caused by outdated keys." message is presented if the keys are outdated when installing a new firmware.

## 1.0.6995 - 2021-08-12
### Fixed
- Fixes a regression that could cause the same compute shader to be compiled over and over again when shader cache was enabled, causing a large performance drop in some games.
  - Fixes performance regression in Hyrule Warriors: Ages of Calamity, and probably other games that uses compute shaders.

## 1.0.6994 - 2021-08-11
### Fixed
- Reverts changes from version 1.0.6987.
  - Fixes regression on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (flickering trees) and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin (invisible huts), probably more.

## 1.0.6993 - 2021-08-11
### Fixed
- Initialize render scales to 1 on the OpenGL backend.
  - Fixes a regression introduced on 1.0.6989 where some games would have a solid colour instead of the correct texture due to the scale value being 0.

## 1.0.6992 - 2021-08-11
### Fixed
- Unify GpuAccessorBase and TextureDescriptorCapableGpuAccessor.
  - Fixes regression introduced in 1.0.6990 that was causing shader TDR.

## 1.0.6991 - 2021-08-11
### Fixed
- Workaround for cubemap view data upload bug on Intel.
  - Fixes eyes rendering of Hatsune Miku.

## 1.0.6990 - 2021-08-11
### Fixed
- Fixes another bug on Intel where gl_FrontFacing returns incorrect values (it seems to be flipped?), the solution here is casting the bool to float and then bitcasting to integer and checking if its non-zero.
  - Fixes rendering of mario mustache on Super Mario Odyssey on Intel (affects both Vulkan and OpenGL).
- Added 2 new functions to the IGpuAccessor interface, used to check if the host has the vector indexing bug (present on AMD) and the front facing bug (present on Intel).
- LDC now uses vector indexing of the form data[offset >> 2][offset & 3] on NVIDIA and Intel, which produces better codegen (and makes shaders easier to read).
- Functions that just returns a host capability on GpuAcessor and CachedGpuAccessor were moved to a common base class to avoid duplication and bugs. In fact, one of them (the one to check the texture shadow LOD capability) was missing from the CachedGpuAccessor, which likely means those shaders were broken on shader cache rebuild on the vendors/drivers that does not support the extension (as the default interface implementation returns true). Now this is fixed.

## 1.0.6989 - 2021-08-11
### Changed
- Use "Undesired" scale mode for certain textures rather than blacklisting.
  - Games that reuse depth stencil between a lot of unrelated draws to textures of different sizes will no longer blacklist from scaling forever. (Bayonetta 2)
  - Textures that are detected as being atlas-like or dof-like will not be locked out of scaling forever - if a depth stencil target is bound when drawing, they can gain res scale. This might result in more 3D UI elements seeing resolution scale. (Xenoblade DE menus, though they're still heavily antialiased)
  - Some other games that randomly blacklist to 1x, or don't scale at all may now work.
  - The approach for blur/dof texture detection has been updated to take into account width alignment, as it can greatly alter the aspect ratio. This fixes small textures failing to detect, which would have cascaded across mipmap texture views and forced textures to scale.
  - Render target scale is now only sent to the backend when its value has changed, rather than each time the scales are evaluated.
  - Scissor and Viewport are only recalculated when the value changes too.

## 1.0.6988 - 2021-08-11
### Fixed
- Make sure attributes used on subsequent shader stages are initialized.
  - Fixes Shadows not working on Zelda Link's awakening (Intel and AMD).
  - Fixes Hatsune Miku eyes being black (Intel and AMD).
  - Fixes Shader failing to compile on Yo-kai Watch 4 (all vendors, no visible effect though?).
  - Probably more...

## 1.0.6987 - 2021-08-11
### Changed
- Improving the speed of vertex buffer updates in some specific cases, where the vertex buffer size is very large. This calculates the vertex buffer size from the max index on the index buffer when the game provided size is too large (above a given threshold), and when the index buffer is small enough.
  - This improves the speed of Super Mario Galaxy, however it appears that this game had a performance regression after range tracking, so the speed seems mostly back to what it was before that. The menu transition however is faster than what it was even before range tracking.

## 1.0.6986 - 2021-08-11
### Fixed
- Do not dirty memory tracking region handles if they are partially unmapped.
  - Fixes crash when loading a save on Dragon Quest XI S.

## 1.0.6985 - 2021-08-11
### Changed
- Replace BGRA and scale uniforms with a uniform block (required for Vulkan).

## 1.0.6984 - 2021-08-11
### Changed
- Improves ServiceNotImplementedException by removing the need to pass in whether the command is a Tipc command or a Hipc command to the exception constructor.

## 1.0.6983 - 2021-08-11
### Added
- Use a new approach for shader BRX targets:
  - Fixes several graphical glitches on Hatsune Miku Project DIVA MEGA 39's.
  - Fixes Bowwow being a white glowing ball on Zelda's Link Awakening.
  - Fixes reflection bug on Cadence of Hyrule.
  - And more...

## 1.0.6982 - 2021-08-04
### Added
- Implement (non-HD) vibrations support:
  - Implement vibration calls of hid service accurately to reverse engineering.
  - You can enable/disable rumble in the controller settings window.
  - HD rumble values are converted to non-HD vibration values, you can choose the multipliers for rumble in the controller settings window.
- Tested working controller are DualSense (PS5), Xbox One, Xbox 360, ProController but working on probably more controllers. Users reports rumble doesn't work on real JoyCons, this will be fixed later if confirmed.

## 1.0.6981 - 2021-08-04
### Fixed:
- Fixes a regression introduced in #2411:
  - Alt key no longer focuses the menu bar. That functionality wasn't really relevant to the original intent of #2411, and the main purpose of the PR remains usable. Focus on Alt is something will might fix later.
  - This reworks the entire flow of how the "Show UI" hotkey works. Note that it is specifically a "Show UI" hotkey, and hiding the UI still has to be done via the Actions menu, as we don't want users to trigger it by accident:
  - The key is now configurable.
  - The key now defaults to F4. Several annoyances was found with Alt, as it's part of the language-switching combination and also getting in the way of taking a (regular, non-Ryujinx) screenshot. Something that's not commonly used made more sense. Of course, due to the previous point above, users are welcome to switch it back to Alt if they are so inclined.
  - Fixing a problem with the implementation of the KeyboardHotkeyState enum which would cause it to break were we to add any more hotkeys.

## 1.0.6980 - 2021-08-04
### Fixes:
- XInput devices provides axis data with square ranges (ie +-32767). Moving the sticks to diagonal ends means that it will have the max range values for both axes. This causes fast motion of player characters in games that do not clamp their input.
  - This fixes it by clamping the input to a circle. Fixes The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD when Link sprinting without using up stamina when the controller sticks are at diagonals.

## 1.0.6979 - 2021-08-04
### Fixes:
- Makes more copies respect non-contiguous GPU virtual memory regions, instead of assuming it is contiguous. After this, the main thing missing will be support for non-contiguous buffers, which will be more complicated, and will be done on a separate PR.
- This also fixes a bug that noticed on I2M, where the copy would be incorrect for block linear textures, if destination X was not a multiple of 16. This was fixed by aligning the start of the vector copy, which should start and end of a multiple of 16. We are not aware of any games that uses it with a X value that is not a multiple of 16 though (it is usually 0), so maybe nothing was affected by this bug.

## 1.0.6978 - 2021-08-04
### Added:
- Improving reporting for cheats and updating the cheat instructions to match Atmosphere's implementation. Those are:
  - A warning is now issued when the cheat tries to write to code region instead of requiring log analysis in debug mode.
  - The cheat names are now printed in the log for better error detection and support.
  - Implemented new addressing modes Alias and Aslr.
  - Implemented else instruction for conditionals.
- Also, with "PPTC with ExeFS Patching" merged, it is now safe to enable cheats to write to code regions (with the aforementioned warning). This is a preparation for the upcoming full support, but does not mean that all cheats will work (some of them may start working).

## 1.0.6977 - 2021-08-04
### Fixed:
- Fixes some audio related issues that caused the emulator to hang or crash at exit, by making audio backend disposal thread safe.
  - Fixes deadlock (causing the emulator to not respond) at exit with the OpenAL backend.
  - Fixes crash at exit with the SDL2 backend due to a double free.
  - Fixes a crash at exit (only when the emulator window was closed) caused by a NRE on window disposal.

## 1.0.6976 - 2021-07-24
### Added:
- Implement an option to hide status and menu bar
  - The option can be found in the Actions menu. You can press alt to make them appears again.

## 1.0.6975 - 2021-07-24
### Fixed
- Fixes a bug where the right JoyCon is not retrieved from Cemuhook and that the right JoyCon motion shared memory is cleared after update.
  - This should allow right JoyCon to work in The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD.

## 1.0.6974 - 2021-07-19
### Changed:
- Further optimizes texture and buffer flush, by reducing the amount of data copies required.
  - Texture layout conversion methods can now write to guest memory directly, in some cases.
  - Methods to get data from GPU now returns the span of the range if a persistent buffer is being used, instead of allocating and doing a copy.
  - Improves the performance on The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, Pokémon Sword/Shield, and likely other games that does texture flushes every frame.

## 1.0.6973 - 2021-07-18
### Changed:
- Fixes a performance regression introduced on version 1.0.6970, by switching to the old flush method on affected drivers.
  - Only Linux AMD drivers and the Intel Windows and Linux drivers are affected, NVIDIA is not affected at all.
  - For the affected drivers, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD and the other affected games are as fast as they were before.

## 1.0.6972 - 2021-07-18
### Changed:
- Improves drastically the code generation of the audren's DSP.
  - This may reduce CPU usage on the audio processing side and result in a better CPU time allocation.

## 1.0.6971 - 2021-07-18
### Changed:
- Improves shader tools command line by adding support for target language and API.
  - No direct user changes.

## 1.0.6970 - 2021-07-16
### Changed:
- Improves performance of buffer and texture flushes by using a different approach.
  - Greatly improves performance of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD.
  - Pokémon Sword/Shield is also improved, however it is still slower than the LDN 2.3 build.
  - Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is sligthly improved.
  - Any other game that does a lot of flushes per frame should be faster aswell.

## 1.0.6969 - 2021-07-14
### Fixed:
- Fixes a bug where data on textures copied using the DMA engine could be lost.
  - Fixes texture corruption (usually visible as black portraits or garbled sprites) on Legend of Mana. Other games might be affected too.

## 1.0.6968 - 2021-07-14
### Fixed:
- Allows draws and compute dispatch without a texture pool and sampler pool being set.
  - Fixes regression on Tales of Vesperia, where the game would crash at boot.
  - An error will be logged if the game attempts to draw with texture or image access without having the pools set.

## 1.0.6967 - 2021-07-14
### Fixed:
- Fixes a bug where the transfer memory handle was not being closed on nvservices, resulting in a handle leak and failure to create a transfer memory at the same region on the guest.

## 1.0.6966 - 2021-07-13
### Changed:
- Revert LibHac update
  - There have been multiple reports of save being destroyed. The issue is being investigated and the update will be rolled again once fixed.

## 1.0.6965 - 2021-07-13
### Fixed:
- Fixes build error of the headless project caused by changes on version 1.0.6964.

## 1.0.6964 - 2021-07-13
### Changed:
- Updates the LibHac dependency to version 0.13.1. This improves the accuracy of the emulator file system implementation, and solve some file system and save related issues on games. See below for a more detailed list of changes.
  - Refactor `FsSrv` to match the official refactoring done in FS.
  - Change how the `Horizon` and `HorizonClient` classes are handled. Each client created represents a different process with its own process ID and client state.
  - Add FS access control to handle permissions for FS service method calls.
  - Add FS program registry to keep track of the program ID, location and permissions of each process.
  - Add FS program index map info manager to track the program IDs and indexes of multi-application programs.
  - Add all FS IPC interfaces.
  - Rewrite `Fs.Fsa` code to be more accurate.
  - Rewrite a lot of `FsSrv` code to be more accurate.

  - Improve waiting and retrying when encountering access issues in `LocalFileSystem` and `DirectorySaveDataFileSystem`.
  - More `IFileSystemProxy` methods should work now.
  - Probably a bunch more stuff.

## 1.0.6963 - 2021-07-12
### Changed:
- Optimizes the GPU Inline-to-Memory engine transfer operations.
  - Might reduce stutters and improve performance a little on games using the OpenGL API on the Switch.

## 1.0.6962 - 2021-07-12
### Fixed:
- Fixes a regression introduced on version 1.0.6957 that caused shaders using rectangle textures to fail to build in some cases.
  - The Touryst now renders properly once again.

## 1.0.6961 - 2021-07-11
### Changed:
- Refactor GPU 3D engine to more closely match the hardware, in addition to fixing bugs.
  - Now all the 3D engine state is per-channel, rather than shared. This completes the work started with the initial GPU channel support.
  - New state modification tracking and host state update method, cleaner and more efficient than the old one.
  - Optimized `DeviceState` register read and write functions.
  - Proper channel state initialization using the same values as the official OS, instead of guessed values.
  - Fixes a bug where the host state was not being updated on changes to the `YNegate` register.
    - Fixes upside down rendering on Cat Girl Without Salad: Amuse Bouche, Dragon Quest Builders, 20XX, Asterix & Obelix XXL2, BLADE ARCUS Rebellion from Shining, and many more.
    - Fixes black screen on Game Tengoku CruisinMix Special (happens when you start a new game). The title can now be considered playable with minor transparency issues.
  - Implement missing `PrimitiveTypeOverrideEnable` register (thanks to ByLaws for testing).
    - Fixes Turok 2 menus rendering.

## 1.0.6960 - 2021-07-11
### Fixed:

  - Fixes crashes on Disaster Report 4, Garfield Kart Furious Racing, and likely more games that crashes/aborts early in the boot process.

## 1.0.6959 - 2021-07-10
### Added:
- Implements CreateApplicationAndRequestToStart of am service.
  - Allow games to restart by themselves if needed. You can now change the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate language in game (Note: Restart doesn't work with OpenAL audio backend due to another issue).

## 1.0.6958 - 2021-07-10
### Fixed:
- Fixes some misc bugs in writable region write-back.
  - No changes expected on games.

## 1.0.6957 - 2021-07-08
### Fixed:
- Fixes resolution scaling when `textureSize` is used with a scaled texture on a compute or pixel shader.
  - Fixes glitches caused by resolution scaling on Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin (visible in battles and a few other places), Monster Hunter Rise (character selection screen on the demo, and a few other places on the full game), and likely more games.
  - Note: Monster Hunter Rise is still not properly scaled in-game, using a resolution mod is still recommended for the best results.

## 1.0.6956 - 2021-07-07
### Fixed:
- Fixes a regression introduced on version 1.0.6894 (POWER update) that caused some games to crash with a invalid memory region exception.

  - This is a minimalist variant of the emulator without a GUI that can be started and configured via command line.
  - **This is available on a separated release zip.** (see **ryujinx-headless-sdl2-{version}** variants on Appveyor)
  - **This doesn't have any updater.**
  - For more information on the options available run it with ``--help``.

## 1.0.6940 - 2021-06-28
### Added:
- Support for running the Mii Editor applet was added.
  - Requires installed firmware 4.0.0+.
  - Mii Editor applet must be launched outside of a game.

## 1.0.6939 - 2021-06-25
### Changed:
- Implements custom (greater than 1) line width support, along with line smoothing support.
  - Fixes incorrect line thickness on the grid that shows on Mario Golf: Super Rush.

## 1.0.6938 - 2021-06-25
### Fixed:
- Fixes unwritten shader output values, which was previously using a value of 0 instead of 1.
  - Fixes missing/invisible geometry on Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin (Trial Version).

## 1.0.6937 - 2021-06-24
### Fixed:
- Fixes some shader compilation failures on shaders using texture depth compare with a LOD parameter and 2D or Cube array textures. Those shaders requires an extension, which is now enabled. On GPUs where the extension is not supported, the LOD parameter is removed.
  - Fixes lighting issues on Mario Golf Super Rush.

## 1.0.6934 - 2021-06-23 
### Changed:
- Implements direct mouse support, similar to the direct keyboard support. This enables games and homebrew that support USB mouse to have that option enabled.
  - Touchscreen is disabled when direct mouse is enabled. Also, the real cursor is hidden while inside the client area (GTK seems to reset the mouse cursor state often, so you will see the mouse pop in once in a short while).

## 1.0.6933 - 2021-06-23
### Changed:
- Implementing supports for multiple GPU channels, enabling games to have separate GPU state. This is usually used when videos are played, as some games creates a separate channel for that. Before this change, a single channel was used for everything, which resulted in crashes as the state ended being corrupted.
  - Fixes rendering of Doukoku Shoshite..., Skullgirls 2nd Encore, COTTOn Reboot!, Dragonball Xenoverse 2 and more.

## 1.0.6932 - 2021-06-23
### Changed:
- This greatly speeds up games that constantly resize buffers, and removes stuttering on games that resize large buffers occasionally.
  - Large improvement on Super Mario 3D All-Stars. Slowdown now is just due to the creation of the OGL buffer resources. (#1663 needed for best performance)
  - Improvement to Hyrule Warriors: AoC, and UE4 games. These games still stutter in general due to texture creation/loading.
  - Small improvement to other games, potential 1-frame stutters avoided.
  - ForceSynchronizeMemory, which was added with POWER, is no longer needed. Some tests have been added for the MultiRegionHandle.

  - Fixes Fullscreen hotkey which needed minimize the window one time before.
  - Fixes Touch input in Mini Metro, Umineko no Naku Koro ni Saku and probably more games.

## 1.0.6927 - 2021-06-23
### Fixed:
- The component order of the instruction is the inverse of the vector returned by textureQueryLod.
  - Fixes blurry graphics on Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, caused by the shader sampling from the wrong texture level (due to the incorrect LOD value).

### Changed:
- Implement GetPlayerLedPattern, SetNpadJoyHoldType, GetNpadJoyHoldType, IsVibrationDeviceMounted (Needed by Super Mario Odyssey) in hid service.
- Implement GetLastActiveNpad, GetNpadSystemExtStyle, GetAppletFooterUiType and stub ApplyNpadSystemCommonPolicy in hid:sys service.

## 1.0.6923 - 2021-06-23
### Changed:
- Unbind input keys in the controller window by middle-clicking while an input is selected.

## 1.0.6922 - 2021-06-22

### Fixed
- Fix a bug that caused one of the account service functions to return an invalid user id if more than one user profile was configured on the emulator.
- Fixes a softlock on Shantae Half-Genie Hero title screen if more than one user profile was present. Might fix similar user profile related issues on other games.

## 1.0.6916 - 2021-06-21
### Changed
- Implement all known AppletMessage values. The new values are not used right now, but might be in the future.
- No expected changes.

## 1.0.6915 - 2021-06-20
### Fixed
- When the (separate) sampler bindless handle comes from the offset 0 of the constant buffer, it was being ignored which caused the wrong sampler to be used. This correct the bug by adding 1 to the offset on the shader translator, and then subtracting 1 on the GPU emulator to ensure that it is never 0 if a separate bindless sampler is used.
  - Fixes rendering issues in Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age.

## 1.0.6914 - 2021-06-19
### Changed
- Stub hid service call: IsFirmwareUpdateAvailableForSixAxisSensor needed by Game Builder Garage (Ignore missing services isn't required anymore).

## 1.0.6913 - 2021-06-16
### Changed
- Loading the default controller profile once again sets the controller type to Pro Controller. When Miria released, the function was changed to load Joycon Pair; this update reverts that change.

## 1.0.6912 - 2021-06-14
### Changed
- Shader decoding is now ended when reaching a block that starts with an infinite loop.

  - Rumble API is exposed **while still not in use for now** (outside the scope of this PR).
- Switched to GTK3 for keyboard input.
- Individual keyboard support was removed (meaning there is no list of keyboards to choose from anymore; only "All Keyboards" is shown as an option).

  - Added an outer header structure and added the hashes for both this new structure and the existing "inner" header structure;
  - Hashes are now handled on a per-section basis and no longer for the entire uncompressed stream.
  - In games with a large exeFS, this "resolves System.IO.IOException: Stream was too long." and "Insufficient memory to continue the execution of the program." error messages. Does *not* resolve "JIT Cache exhausted" error. This will be resolved in a future PR.

  - There is currently a bug in Monster Hunter Rise that requires spamming the 'A' button in order for the screenshot function to work the first time. This is being worked on and will hopefully be fixed soon!
- To retrieve screenshots:
    1. Click on File > Open Ryujinx Folder.
    2. Drill down to the sdcard -> Nintendo -> Album folder.
    3. Screenshots will be saved in dated subfolders e.g. %AppData%\Ryujinx\sdcard\Nintendo\Album\2021\03\26\2021032601020300-0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF.jpg

## 1.0.6800 - 2021-03-25
### Added
- Implemented CPU instructions: Sqdmulh_Ve & Sqrdmulh_Ve Inst.s with tests.
  - Fixes missing opcode crash on Monster Hunter Rise.

## 1.0.6799 - 2021-03-25
### Added

  - Fixes a missing service crash on CARRION, The Witch and The 66 Mushrooms, Pixel Game Maker Series Werewolf Princess Kaguya, Monster Hunter Rise v1.1.1, and any other/future game created with Nintendo SDK 11.x.

## 1.0.6798 - 2021-03-24
### Changed
- Cleaned up sfdnsres service implementation and added several related services:
  - Implemented GetAddrInfoRequest. Partially implemented GetHostByNameRequestWithOptions, GetHostByAddrRequestWithOptions and GetAddrInfoRequestWithOptions.
    - Fixes missing service crashes on over 100 tested games. Many games that could not boot before are now playable; some cannot go in-game if designed to rely on a connection to the internet (which is blocked).
  - Added a DNS blacklist to prevent games from reaching Nintendo online services.
- Reduces code differences between master and the LDN build.

## 1.0.6797 - 2021-03-22
### Changed
- Optimized the operation of & code for the GUI progress reporting (PPTC & Shader Cache loading bars).
  - Fixes an issue that could cause a string of GTK-related code warnings to pop-up in the console upon opening the emulator.

## 1.0.6795/1.0.6796 - 2021-03-20
### Changed
- Adjusted some CI build configurations.

## 1.0.6794 - 2021-03-19
### Changed
- The shader cache now detects and avoids caching shaders that use bindless textures.
  - Prevents corruption of the shader cache that could cause a crash on launch in games that have bindless textures (mostly Unreal Engine 4 games).
  - This is a temporary stopgap solution to resolve shader cache issues until proper bindless support is implemented.

## 1.0.6793 - 2021-03-18
### Fixed
- Improved linear texture compatibility rules.
  - Resolves an issue where small or width-aligned (rather than byte aligned) textures would fail to create a view of existing data. Creates a copy dependency, as size change may be risky. View layout compatibility is now determined by the stride shifted by the level, rather than a stride caculated from the level's width. Linear textures are considered copy compatible when they have matching stride.
    - Fixes missing lens flare in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Splatoon 2.
    - Fixes an issue causing Cross Code to boot to a black screen.

## 1.0.6792 - 2021-03-18
### Changed
- Removed the IIpcService.cs interface references as it is no longer needed or used.

## 1.0.6791 - 2021-03-18
### Added
- Added more items to standard logs for troubleshooting purposes.
  - Now logs Docked/Handheld state/toggling, selected audio backend, and Vsync status/toggling.

## 1.0.6790 - 2021-03-18
### Added
- Implemented ApplicationErrorArg to the Error Applet.
  - This was already implemented in the LDN build and as such has already undergone sufficient testing.
  - Reduces code differences between the LDN build and master.

## 1.0.6789 - 2021-03-18
### Changed
- Reworded some pop-up dialog boxes for better clarity of the messages to the end user. No emulator functionality changes.

## 1.0.6788 - 2021-03-18
### Added
- Added Amiibo scan emulation of all Amiibos.
  - Uses a self-hosted fork of the AmiiboAPI RESTful API. No need to scan any bin files!
  - Amiibo can be trained in Super Smash Bros.
To scan an Amiibo:
1. Go to the Amiibo-specific scanning location or in-game menu option in a supported game.
2. Click on the Ryujinx Actions menu header > Scan an Amiibo. That's it!

## 1.0.6787 - 2021-03-16
### Changed
- Improved the grammar in a code comment. No emulator functionality changes.

## 1.0.6786 - 2021-03-15
### Changed
- Improved portable mode operation:
  - Implemented an auto-enabling of portable mode if the user places a subfolder named "portable" beneath the Ryujinx program folder. If detected, Ryujinx will automatically use it as the default location for all system files (keys/PPTC/shaders etc.).
    - Using this method, the Ryujinx program folder is now fully able to be moved around at will without needing to use any special shortcuts or command line parameters, and will still retain portable functionality. Thanks to a previous enhancement to the auto-update function, the "portable" subfolder will be preserved during auto-update processes.

## 1.0.6785 - 2021-03-14
### Fixed
- Fixed a typo in a debug assert message within the OpenAL implementation details.

## 1.0.6784 - 2021-03-14
### Changed
- The active audio device is now reported as a TV, rather than internal speakers.
  - Fixes noticeably poor audio quality in Pokémon Sword and Shield, and potentially other games.
  - May also enable 5.1 audio output on games where it was not functioning properly before.

## 1.0.6783 - 2021-03-13
### Changed
- Implemented an override to the openal-soft audio output mode to fix a potential loss in audio quality while using the OpenAL backend if Windows audio output was in headphone mode.

## 1.0.6782 - 2021-03-13
### Fixed
- Fixed a Github actions warning. No emulator code changes.

## 1.0.6781 - 2021-03-10
### Fixed
- ILibraryAppletAccessor handles are now closed on disposal.
  - Fixes an issue where if a game was calling the controller applet multiple times it could result in an "out of handles" crash.

## 1.0.6780 - 2021-03-09
### Fixed
- Fixed lineSize for LinearStrided to Linear conversion.
  - Fixes a possible crash when width is greater than stride, which can happen due to alignment when copying textures with the copy buffer method. The only currently known game where this had occurred is Bravely Default II.

## 1.0.6779 - 2021-03-09
### Changed
- Emulator now allows bindless handles to be found for image/texture instructions with predicates, when the assignment of the texture handle is within the same predicate.
  - Fixes character shadows and black, soulless eyes on Bravely Default II.
  - Fixes broken rendering in the Billiards and Shooting Gallery mini-games in 51 Worldwide Games.
  - Probably fixes other broken rendering in games with bindless textures.
  - Resolves conflicts between bindless textures and shader cache that previously required shader cache to be purged or disabled prior to each boot of certain affected games.
    - For affected games (such as Super Mario Party, 51 Worldwide Games, and many newer UE4 games) you may purge the shader cache once. Note: not all UE4 games are yet shader cache compatible.

## 1.0.6778 - 2021-03-08
### Fixed
- Reworked Buffer Textures to create their buffers in the TextureManager, then bind them with the BufferManager later.
  - Fixes an issue where a buffer texture's buffer could be invalidated after it is bound, but before use.
- Fixed width unpacking for large buffer textures. The width is now 32-bit rather than 16.
- Forced buffer textures to be rebound whenever any buffer is created, as using the handle id wasn't reliable, and the cost of binding isn't too high.
- The sum of these fixes vertex explosions and flickering animations in UE4 games. May affect games that use ImageStore, as now those textures are flushed on read/write.
  - Resolves all known lighting issues in Fire Emblem: Three Houses.

## 1.0.6777 - 2021-03-07
### Changed
- Modified the component mask to be flipped if the target is BGRA.
  - On its own, should not result in any visible changes. Requires better bindless texture handling in order for visual improvements to be realized (such as fixing the shadows in Braveley Default II battles).

## 1.0.6776 - 2021-03-06
### Changed
- Removed unused physical region memory tracking.
  - Accelerates memory unmap/remap of virtual addresses that were once used for GPU resources, as well as reduce the cost of creating new tracking handles.
    - Reduces load times and non-shader related stutter in games that perform many unmap/remap operations such as Unreal Engine 4 games, among others.
  - Tracking regions/handles are now notified about an unmap operation before they are actually unmapped.
Example of non-shader related stutter being improved by this update:

## 1.0.6775 - 2021-03-06
### Changed
- Improved handling for unmapped GPU resources.
  - Fixed a memory tracking bug that would set protection on empty PTEs (caused some buffer tracking crashes).
  - When a texture's memory is (partially) unmapped, all pool references are forcibly removed and the texture must be rediscovered to draw with it. This will also force the texture discovery to always compare the texture's range for a match.
  - RegionHandles now know if they are unmapped, and automatically unset their dirty flag when unmapped.
  - Partial texture sync now loads only the region of textures that has been modified. Unmapped memory tracking handles cause dirty flags for a texture group handle to be ignored.
  - Significantly improves emulator stability in newer UE4 games such as Bravely Default II.
  - Fixes texture swaps in Bravely Default II. Note: this game still suffers from some graphical issues such as random vertex explosions, missing facial animations, and missing shadows.
  - Improves emulator stability in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
  - Fixes a regression causing a crash on launch in Contra: Rogue Corps. The game is once again playable.

## 1.0.6774 - 2021-03-04
### Fixed
- Fixed SetStandardSteadyClockInternalOffset permission check.

## 1.0.6773 - 2021-03-02
### Changed
- Added loading bars at the bottom of the main window for pre-boot host shader cache building and PPTC translation operations to give users a visual indicator of boot progress. 
  - Removed associated console entries for both of these activities. Rebuilding shaders after an invalidating event will show both in the console and in the loading bar.

## 1.0.6772 - 2021-03-02
### Added
- Added fast paths in the audio renderer for AArch64 in all current fast paths.

## 1.0.6771 - 2021-03-02
### Changed
- Improved efficiency of "Hide Cursor on Idle" operation to minimize overhead.

## 1.0.6770 - 2021-03-02
### Changed
GPU:
- Fixed various issues with view compatibility, synchronization and creation.
- Greatly improved texture view creation, keeping it within a strict storage-view hierarchy. (no view-views)
  - Fixes a memory leak in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. Its VRAM usage is now rather low. :)
- Reworked texture memory tracking to use a structure called a "Texture Group".
  - There is one texture group for each storage texture, and views of that storage cover a subset of its "Texture Group Handles".
    - A handle can represent one or more sub-image, which can be a mip level, array layer, cubemap face or 3d texture slice.
    - This allows memory tracking to be shared between views, which is good as they also share internal data.
  - This fixes issues where cpu texture invalidation would be missed or repeat sync when using multiple views of the same texture.
  - Affected games:
    - Fixed swapping textures in Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition, Xenoblade 2, MH:GU, potentially other games.
- Introduces "Copy Dependencies" between handles of a texture group - indicating that their contents must be copied to another texture after modification.
  - Allows copies between two textures that are view compatible, but have different storages.
  - Replaces two old copy-on-create methods that were used for rendering to 3D and compressed textures.
    - Also removes the workaround for keeping the copied data in these textures, which was to disable memory tracking for them entirely.
    - This fixes colour ramps in a large number of first party games such as Super Mario Odyssey, where they would use the first rendered version of the 3D texture and look incorrect on future levels/rooms.
  - Affected games:
    - Fixes nearly all issues with cubemaps/lighting in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
    - Fixes issues in Splatoon 2 where lighting would be unusually dark on the first load of the plaza, or on random stages.
    - Fixes issues in Splatoon 2 where the time remaining or menu button text would be missing or incorrect.
    - Fixes a lot of issues with textures in A Hat In Time (Unreal Engine 3)
    - Fix issues with textures in Yoshi's Crafted World, and generally other Unreal Engine 4 games
      - Bravely Default 2 requires its own set of gpu memory management fixes, coming some point soon.
    - Fixes issues with DOF in Animal Crossing: New Horizons (as well as Copy Dependencies)
    - Pikmin 3's intro video is now visible. Any possible issues with the Koppad have been thwarted.
    - Probably a lot more.
  - Should greatly decrease chance of GPU memory becoming corrupted by a texture flush.
- Reworked size calculation for mipmapped 3D textures.
  - Fixes fog, waves, water caustics, mario dirt overlay and much more in Super Mario Odyssey (also needs copy dependencies)

  - Audio Renderer now initializes its backend on demand instead of keeping two up all the time.
  - All audio backend implementations are now in their own project.
  - Ryujinx.Audio.Renderer was renamed to Ryujinx.Audio and as such appropriately refactored.
  - Resolves a missing audin service crash in FUZE4.
  - Resolves an audout-related crash on launch in OniNaki.

### Added
- Implemented VCNT instruction.
  - Fixes a missing opcode crash on Valkyria Chronicles, which now goes in-game.

## 1.0.6670 - 2021-02-21
### Changed
- PPTC & Pool Enhancements:
  - Fixed memory instability / excessive memory spikes in some "heavy" games after loading/saving .cache files (fixes issue reported by users);
  - Fixed limitation of loading/saving large .cache files (fixes issue reported by users);
  - Reduced memory usage when loading/saving .cache files;

  - Fixed redundant saving / log spamming of .info files (fixes issue reported by users);
  - Added a simple PtcFormatter library for deserialization/serialization, which does not require reflection, in use at PtcJumpTable and PtcProfiler; improves maintainability and simplicity / readability of affected code.
  - Improved handling of Pools (Slim) for PPTC, allowing to halve the number of pools in use and thus reducing memory usage and slightly increasing the translation speed (you save ~1 second every 1k translations (for a CPU with 4+4 cores); so for 30k translations you save ~30 seconds (for the same CPU));
  - BitMap pools are now limited during use and disposed after use;
  - Pools Limiter is now configurable.

## 1.0.6667 - 2021-02-21

### Fixed
- Fixed a crash on exit of the emulator and a crash on stopping emulation, both occurring on Linux.
  - Resolves an issue preventing embedded games from launching on Linux (as launching embedded games first stops emulation, which was crashing the emulator).

## 1.0.6341 - 2021-01-17
### Changed
- Implemented lazy flush-on-read for Buffers (SSBO/Copy). This allows SSBO data to be written back to guest memory when it's needed.
  - Fixes flickering in Link's Awakening.
  - This also allows data written into an SSBO to be used as part of a draw command, or by other operations within the GPU. This is required for MH: Rise Demo.
- As part of lazy flushing, when a page is dirtied by CPU, it is assumed that the most recently written SSBOs are not the target of the CPU write, and are not updated.
  - Fixes particle effects that were broken or constantly restarted their animation in many first party games. See the PR for visual examples.
- Greatly speed up buffer copies via two new paths (direct cpu copy, or lazy buffer flush) chosen depending on whether the buffer has been written to before.
  - Mostly affects performance in Unity games and Pokémon (which has other issues).
  - A combination of all changes has fixed vertex explosions in Unity games.
  - Hyrule Warriors vertex explosions are somewhat reduced (but can still happen)

## 1.0.6318 - 2021-01-13
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in the LOP3 shader causing a condition to be read from the wrong bits.
  - As shader changes occurred, shader caches have been gracefully invalidated; the next time a game is launched the cache will automatically rebuild at boot time.

## 1.0.6311 - 2021-01-13

## 1.0.6301 - 2021-01-12
### Added
- Added a simple pools limiter.
  - Reduces emulator memory usage. The amount of memory usage savings are dependent on the game but test results showed an average of 50% reduction.
  - Avoids memory peaks on launch; spikes nearing or equaling the amount of your RAM should no longer occur.
  - Further reduces game load times, with the amount of time saved varying game to game. Average time reduction of 10-15%.
  
## 1.0.6291 - 2021-01-11

- Cleaned up/removed long <-> ulong casts from Nvservices code.
  - Code cleanup only. No emulator functionality change.

## 1.0.6196 - 2021-01-01
### Changed
- Updated KAddressArbiter implementation to 11.x kernel.
  - Update Wait/SignalProcessWideKey implementation to match changes made on official 11.0 kernel.
    - They now store a bool at the key address indicating if the number of threads waiting the condition variable is > 0. Games targeting firmware 11.0 or newer needs this to work properly (no games are know to target it so far).
  - Update SignalAndModifyIfEqual implementation to match changes made on official 7.0 kernel.
    - The way how the value is modified changed. Games targeting firmware 7.0 or newer might need this to work properly.
  - Fix a bug where SignalToAddress would use the old priority even if the thread priority was updated after it started waiting (I'm not sure if this was a bug that was present on 6.x kernel or just an oversight).
  - Simplified the code by sharing the function used to wake matching threads and remove them from the list. The `InsertSortedByPriority` function was also removed since it sorts by priority when looking for threads now.
  - Based on mesosphere implementation. 

## 1.0.6194 - 2021-01-01
### Changed

## 1.0.6182 - 2020-12-30
### Changed
- Redistribute updated OpenAL binary.
  - WWe now include a copy of OpenAL out-of-the box with Ryujinx. This removes the need to manually download and install OpenAL. We've also moved from using the fork provided by openal.org to the fork provided by openal-soft.org which is still maintained, and has had 1000's of improvements over the old version. This should improve OpenAL audio issues slightly in some games that suffered previously.

## 1.0.6176 - 2020-12-29
### Added
- Implemented the ability to add new executables when running a game. This allows more possibilities for game modding.

  - Reduction of the size of both the .info and the .cache files.
  - Faster deserialization/serialization (implies reduced loading/saving times).
  - Saving of JitCache memory.
  - Improved Logs.

## 1.0.6122 - 2020-12-17
### Changed
- Interrupt GPU command processing when a frame becomes ready, presenting it immediately.
  - Greatly improves frame pacing in games that do not wait for a present before starting to draw the next frame (and run below full speed)
  - Examples: Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition, Xenoblade 2
- Vsync event and surface flinger consumption now happens at exact timings (eg. 16.6667ms) rather than rounding to the nearest millisecond (16/17ms)
  - Greatly improves games that rely on the vsync event for timing, such as Link's Awakening, or unity games that aren't tied to frame count.
  - Should result in less framerate fluctuation.
  - Improves frame consistency in windowed mode, though it can still get out of sync and double frames. Exclusive fullscreen mode should be perfect.
- Overhauled Vsync off mode. Rather than simulating a vsync every 1ms, it will now simulate a vsync every time a frame is produced. This results in higher max framerates.
  - Alongside, the artificial 60fps limit has been removed. If you disable your vsync using driver config, or have a high refresh rate screen, you can now go over 60fps.
  - With a 60hz display and driver vsync enabled, you can disable guest vsync to pass through the host vsync signal. This may result in smoother windowed mode gameplay.
- FIFO% now takes a running total of processing time and total time, then calculates the % immediately before reporting it. This is more accurate.
  - Before, it would take % values for each "frame", then average all of them. This was inaccurate when our "frame" boundary failed, or frames had uneven cost.

## 1.0.6119 - 2020-12-16
### Added
- Implemented IsLargeResourceAvailable service call.
  - Fixes missing service crashes in Immortals Fenyx Rising (still crashes due to other issues) and Death Tales (now playable).

## 1.0.6107 - 2020-12-16

Note: non-16:9 will give games a stretched or squeezed appearance unless also using mods that change the expected resolution of the game.

## 1.0.6082 - 2020-12-15
### Added
- Implemented a wake-up (resume) message/event. This can be triggered while in-game by navigating to Options > Simulate Wake-up Message.
  - Allows the game The World Ends with You -Final Remix- to proceed past a point in the game where it prompts the end user to put the Switch to sleep and then wake it back up.

## 1.0.6069 - 2020-12-14
### Added

## 1.0.6051 - 2020-12-13
### Changed
- Improved shader cache resilience by supporting read-only mode if the cache.zip archive is already opened (i.e. if the game is launched in a second instance of the emulator).

## 1.0.6050 - 2020-12-13
### Fixed

  - Fixes the following games which used to hang forever on boot: Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Megamix (non-JP version), Super Chariot, Death Mark, Darkest Dungeon, Dairoku: Ayakashimori, CHAOS CODE -NEW SIGN OF CATASTROPHE-, Doukoku Soshite..., Air Missions: HIND, and possibly other (untested) similarly coded games in the switch library. These games now boot and most go in-game.

## 1.0.6047 - 2020-12-12
### Fixed
- Corrected the GetNintendoAccountUserResourceCacheForApplication stub.
  - Fixes a regression introduced in 1.0.6045 (PR 1808).

## 1.0.6045 - 2020-12-11
### Fixed

### Changed
- Cleaned up the GPU memory allocator code.

## 1.0.6020 - 2020-12-10
### Changed
- Modified allocator code to check if the aligned address and its requirements exceed the maximum allowed address, with a solution if the results are true.
  - Fixed a regression introduced in 1.0.6004 (PR 1722) that caused Asterix & Obelix XXL: Romastered to crash on boot.

## 1.0.6006 - 2020-12-09
### Changed
- Fixed the ngct services placeholder which was incorrect.
- Stubbed IService Match and Filter calls, as well as IServiceWithManagementApi Match and Filter calls.
  - Resolves missing service crashes in Horace, which is now playable.

## 1.0.6005 - 2020-12-09
### Changed
- Modified ThreadPool process handling to keep it active so that there is never a reason to terminate the GateThread.
  - Raises FPS from 57-58 to 60 in games where the game should have been pegged at 60FPS already.

## 1.0.6004 - 2020-12-09
### Changed
- Modified GPU memory allocation by marking memory as available in an implementation of a Red-Black-Tree affectionately christened a TreeDictionary.
  - Improves memory allocation and reduces time for certain GPU memory related operations.

## 1.0.6003 - 2020-12-09
### Changed
- Rewrote scheduler context switch code.
  - Now uses a lock to prevent the thread from being scheduled in two cores at once, like the official OS does.
  - Fixed thread CurrentCore value being updated ahead of time. Now it is only updated after the thread is switched to the new core.
  - Fixed bugs on some yield functions that could cause the scheduler to select the wrong thread.
  - Fixed bugs that would cause KThread and KSession reference counts to be decremented below 0. For KThread, it could cause a exception since the thread was removed from the KProcess thread list twice (only observed in single core mode before the changes).
  - Two asserts were added to ensure the reference count is not decremented below 0, or incremented after the object has been "destroyed".
  - Fixed race on unmap client buffer function (IPC related, not scheduler related, but its a small, simple change as was affecting the tests here as well, so I decided to just fix it).

Other improvements:
- Core idle time is now properly reported to the guest instead of just returning 0 (I am not sure if games can actually read that).
- GetCurrentThread and GetCurrentProcess functions were simplified, now it uses a thread local variable instead of looping through all core contexts and try finding the current thread.
- Context switch speed was improved. This is in part thanks to the use of ManualResetEventSlim, that greatly improves the speed on context switches in quick succession, and in part to the simplification of the function.
- The dummy thread and process were removed. Now GetCurrentThread and GetCurrentProcess just returns null if called from a non-guest or non-service thread.
  - Prevents bugs caused by external threads messing with the scheduler.
  - A new function was added that allows creating a guest process/thread from a external thread, this is used to start service faux processes.
- Allow service threads to run in parallel again.
  - They can be still be blocked by kernel in some cases, like when waiting for IPC messages for example, however they are no longer scheduled to cores, which means that they are free to run in parallel.
  - The YieldUntilCompletion function was removed as it is no longer needed.
  - This matches the behavior before ipc-part2, and fixes issues caused by this specific ipc-part2 change, like the audio crackling on SMO etc.

Other changes:
- Single core mode was removed. Now there is only multi core mode that is on by default.
  - The GUI checkbox was removed.
  - It is worth noting that the single core mode was not working anyway due to the bug mentioned before.

## 1.0.5939 - 2020-12-03
### Changed
- Changed uses of QueryModified to now pass a cached delegate.
- Changed buffer tracking to use simple tracking rather than smart, as in practice smart tracking does not seem to be faster.
  - Combined, these changes nearly halve buffer tracking time in Super Mario Odyssey Metro Kingdom's initial view. Future PRs will help unlock more tangible performance boosts.

## 1.0.5937 - 2020-12-03

## 1.0.5899 - 2020-12-01
### Changed
- This is part 2 of an intended 4 part IPC (Inter-Process Communication) refactor. Part 2: HLE services now use the ReplyAndReceive syscall to receive IPC requests, rather than having special handling on the kernel that would call the service function directly after a call to SendSyncRequest by the game.
  - This represents a more accurate approach to these processes, as it attempts to more closely mimic how the Switch OS behaves.

## 1.0.5897 - 2020-12-01
### Changed
- Added a forced early Z test register.

- Fixed SetAudioOutVolume and GetAudioOutVolume.

## 1.0.5782 - 2020-11-20
### Changed
- Allowed copy destinations to have a different scale from the source. This has the following effects on resolution scaling:
  - Now works in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (with some shadow artifacts).
  - No longer blacklists/stops working in some cutscenes in Super Mario Odyssey.

## 1.0.5778 - 2020-11-20
