LDN
===

This feature emulates the "Local Play" or "Local Wireless" multiplayer mode in a particular game, but connects you with other Ryujinx players anywhere in the world with internet access. 

Note: this feature does _**not**_ work with "Online Mode", which uses the Nintendo Switch Online service. 

### Requirements:
- An active high-speed internet connection.
- The Ryujinx application must be enabled for inbound traffic in your firewall if you are the game host. Windows Firewall, if enabled, will pop-up prompting you to allow access. Make sure to allow it!
- UPNP enabled in your router/firewall for P2P mode (most routers already have this enabled). Otherwise the game can still work (albeit with higher latency) using the proxy host.
- The same game version as those you are playing with e.g. Animal Crossing: New Horizons 2.0.5; mixing game versions will _**not**_ work!

### Configuration Options:

Multiplayer support via P2P network hosting is already enabled by default in this preview build. In most setups, it will simply work without any configuration.

**Specific Options:**

We recommend creating a user profile and choosing your username in **Options > Manage User Profiles** before going online, as the default profile is known to cause connection issues in some games.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79612681/185624289-ab7c877a-f1ef-4c16-84c9-14b847e02b7a.png)

You will have to transfer your saves if you had any on the default profile. To access them, switch to the old profile then right click your game and click on `Open User Save Directory`.

_**Mode:**_  
Set to _Ryujinx Ldn_ by default. There are 3 modes:
- Disabled - Multiplayer functionality is disabled. If you're planning on using this, that's a sign you should just use our [latest regular build](https://ryujinx.org/download) instead.
- Ryujinx LDN - This enables standard connectivity with Ryujinx users over the internet ONLY.
- ldn_mitm - Enables connectivity with a CFW (hacked) Nintendo Switch AND other Ryujinx users on the same network.

_**Disable P2P Network Hosting:**_  
Unchecked by default. If you are experiencing connectivity issues and cannot get P2P to work, you may check the box labeled "Disable P2P Network Hosting (may increase latency)" to instead use the Ryujinx proxy host server.

_**Network Passphrase:**_  
Empty by default. When empty, you will be able to connect to anyone else playing the same game version as yourself. To play with friends, either create a passphrase yourself or click the "Generate Random" button and share it with them, then have them enter the same passphrase. This will prevent unwanted parties from joining your game, as well as limit the number of potential rooms to join for popular games like Mario Kart 8. We want to make sure you get to the right Grand Prix!

How to play LDN
======
While LDN is available on a vast amount of games, here are some of the most popular ones and how to access Ryujinx LDN on them.
 
Before playing LDN multiplayer, go to Options > Settings > System and ensure "Enable Guest Internet Access" is OFF and "Enable Vsync" is ON, then head to Multiplayer settings and ensure the mode is set to "Ryujinx Ldn" if you want to play online, or "ldn_mitm" if you want to play with others in the same local network. Once the emulator enters local wireless, a Windows firewall warning will appear. Make sure to allow it to connect.

If you're looking for people to play with, we have dedicated LDN channels in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ryujinx).

Animal Crossing: New Horizons
==========  
Head to Dodo Airlines, talk to Orville, choose either "I wanna fly!" or "I want visitors.", and then select "Via local play."

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79612681/185639984-f29ab392-839a-4ed1-ad23-144b8304d9bb.png)

Fast RMX
==========  
On the main menu, select "Multiplayer" and then "Local communication".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79612681/185659376-dd965ffe-38a9-49f4-a68f-7daed0e40ce3.png)

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
==========  
**This game requires a built shader cache to play LDN.** The game will disconnect if any given player cannot maintain 60fps, and shader compilation stuttering will cause connection errors. If you are experiencing issues, run through every course in single-player first. On fast CPUs, shader compilation may not be a problem when running Vulkan.

On the main menu, select "Wireless Play" and then "1p". "2p" is only for playing LDN with splitscreen, for when you have someone else with you, either in person or on Parsec.

Mario Party Superstars
==========  
**This game requires version 1.0.0 of the game to work on LDN.** It's also prone to disconnecting if no shader cache has been built, though less so than Mario Kart 8.

On the main menu, select "Local Play". 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79612681/185641629-db09227e-eb93-4a42-9f42-88e9d2a084fc.png)

Mario Strikers: Battle League
==========  
**This game requires [a mod to bypass the intro crash](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/files/12786472/cutscene.skip.-.piplup.zip).**
Right click the game > Open mods directory, and extract on the folder.

On the main menu, select "Quick battle", then select "Local wireless".

LAN Mode
========

`Enable Guest Internet Access` allows you to connect with a Switch console on the same network as your PC running Ryujinx, as long as the game supports LAN as well. This feature is available on mainline Ryujinx too. See below for a list of games with a LAN mode.
